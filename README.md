Project Title:  INVESTIGATE A RELATIONAL DATABASE
 Description:
 I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer questions about the database.
 The project end-result is a presentation of four slides. Each slide
: ● Has a question of interest
. ● Has a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question
. ● Has a supporting visualization created using the final data of my SQL query that answers my question of interest.
 The four questions of interest are:
 ● *What are the most successful categories among the family movies ? 
* ● What is the distribution of family-friendly movies among the film categories and rental duration categories ? 
● How does the two stores compare in their count of rental orders ? 
● Who are the top 10 paying customers ? 
How many did each paid in total ?
